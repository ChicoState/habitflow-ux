# Scenarios

Jason knows that he has 3 midterm exams coming in 3 weeks.  He also has regular assignments to complete in the meantime, so he is worried that he will miss an assignment or fall behind on his studies for the exams.  The stress from this dilemma has Jason craving a cigarette, even though he knows he’s been smoke free for 4 days.  Jason is wondering how he can keep himself accountable for maintaining his study schedule, while sticking to his goal to quit smoking.



Joey just got home after a tiring day of manual labor and sits down to ponder on what he plans to spend his night doing. Soon after he starts to tap is hands on his knees and realizes he is hungry and should cook dinner. Throughout the prep he debates whether or not he should have a drink while he cooks or even with his meal but at the same time knows that he will regret it if he does. “What can I do to keep my mind off the temptation” he thinks to himself.
