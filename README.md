# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* We determined that the habit tracking portion of the app should be accessible in as few clicks as possible. Since users may be tracking multiple habits, updating the count of a habit could become tedious if it is too complex.

* One of the competitors we analyzed was well put together from a big picture point of view, but some smaller interactions were confusing.  Error messages were vague and offered no suggestions for fixing the problem, and there was no way to reset a habit's count without deleting the habit and remaking it.

* Some sort of a reward for completing good habits/tasks, and a penalty for completing bad habits could help incentivize users to keep working towards their goals and keep them engaged with the app.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* Users want to be able to check their progress quickly

* Users want to be reminded to complete unfinished tasks/habits

* Users would like to be rewarded for completing habits/tasks.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

* We gained user feedback on our prototype via conducting user test studies

* Users were asked about prior experience with habit tracking apps, ideal features, and points of confusion and difficulty

* Mostly positive responses with confusion coming from the way we worded protocol tasks and labels on the prototype

* We need to add further interactivity with the registration page and further context clues in _add task_ page where the user selects the type of task they are tracking

* Users indicated they would like to see more scheduling options as well as confirmation on editing and deletion of tasks to prevent accidental data loss

* Users indicated that they enjoyed the design of the task addition besides the slight confusion regarding the _task/habit_ label

* We need to revise and refine the ordering of tasks 3 and 4 as some users felt it confusing

* We need to be revise the wording of some tasks to make them more distinct to the user and more consistent for the interviewers
