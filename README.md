# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* We determined that the habit tracking portion of the app should be accessible in as few clicks as possible. Since users may be tracking multiple habits, updating the count of a habit could become tedious if it is too complex.

* One of the competitors we analyzed was well put together from a big picture point of view, but some smaller interactions were confusing.  Error messages were vague and offered no suggestions for fixing the problem, and there was no way to reset a habit's count without deleting the habit and remaking it.

* Some sort of a reward for completing good habits/tasks, and a penalty for completing bad habits could help incentivize users to keep working towards their goals and keep them engaged with the app.
