# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

HabitFlow is a habit and task tracking app that is designed to help users reach their short and long term goals.  The focus for this sprint was to design an interface for the app, get feedback on our initial design, then make changes to the interface design according to the feedback.

## Methods

During phase 2 of our evolving project we used two new methods to gather information and insight into how we can better adapt our app for better usability. The first method we explored and utilized was a cognitive walkthrough. In which we had two UX students from other groups look over our personas and the respective scenarios laid out on how each persona would like to use the app to suit their needs. Each participant would then keep the persona and scenario in mind while walking through the HabitFlow wireframe imitating how the persona would interact with it in order to play out their scenario and reach their end goal. The second method we used was called crowdsourcing. We had the 6 person software engineering team behind HabitFlow display their app and demo it to a crowd of other software engineering students and follow up the demo by asking the roughly 29 other students a question about how they can further improve the app. The question we had them pose was “What additional features could we add to our app to encourage users to continue to track their habits?”.

## Findings

The cognitive walkthrough of our initial design gave mostly positive responses, but we did get some helpful feedback about some of the smaller app interactions we had overlooked.  In our initial design, we had forgotten to add a login screen to correspond to the logout button in the settings menu which confused one reviewer.  Another reviewer suggested that we add a button to sort the results on the progress screen, as an unsorted list could be difficult to read.

The software team's demo of their work in progress version of HabitFlow also gave us some helpful insights into what would encourage users to engage with the app.  The most popular response was adding reminder notifications to the app for habits and tasks, along with a daily reminder to the user to log their habit progress.  Another popular response was to incentivize the user to keep up with their habits by adding habit communities to keep people accountable, adding game mechanics to make habit tracking more engaging, or offering discount coupons to people who complete a certain number of tasks or habits per week.

## Conclusions

The software team's demo gave us good feedback about what HabitFlow users would want from the app.  We added options in the settings menu to enable and disable reminder notifications in response to the recommendations we got.  Going forward, we are going to focus on keeping users engaged and completing their goals in our UX designs, such as a notification to the user reminding them of their habits if they haven't logged any progress on a specific habit that day.

The findings from our cognitive walkthrough were helpful in reminding us not to overlook the smaller details in our UX designs.  When designing the homepage for the app, we made the assumption that we were designing the app from the perspective of a logged in user, which led us to leave out the login page in our wireframe. When designing the progress page, we didn't consider that the list of habits may become larger than the screen and would need to be scrolled through, which caused us to leave out a sort button for the data.  In the future, we'll try to design our interfaces from both the perspective of a brand new user, and one that has been using the app for a long time.

## Caveats

Being a part of a school usability program, and not having any sort of proper funding, we are only able to draw from other usability and software development students and not get as much of a real world variety of "users". All of us have some technological literacy since we are a part of a STEM tech-based program, and are all amidst creating and planning for apps and websites. Having a greater range of personas and scenarios would add opportunity for greater discovery and insights however it is just not feasible to have so many groups all walkthrough that many scenarios in a timely and efficient manner. Same goes for planning out time for multiple Q & A's for the software engineering teams.
