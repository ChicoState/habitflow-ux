# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

HabitFlow is a customizable habit tracker and calendar app that helps users to achieve their daily goals, whether they are trying to make good habits, or break bad ones.  Phase one of the project is focused on tracking the user's daily habits in an intuitive way and providing insights into their progress towards making good habits or breaking bad ones.

## Methods

For this phase of the project, we chose to evaluate and research competitors using the heuristic evaluation method. We both decided Habitica would be our biggest competitor as they are also a habit tracker app that mainly focus and push gamification into their design and our software engineers initially pitched their idea to involve gamification as well. The purpose of the heuristic evaluation is to get hands on with their app and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their usability against heuristics. The heuristics we chose to evaluate are Nielsons 10 heuristics. Neither of the two members who conducted the research had prior experience using habitica or any habit tracker before, but are well versed in computer science and the tech literacy. After conducting our individual evaluations we compared and contrastedour views to discuss what they did well and what could be improved.

## Findings

After evaluating habitica using our heuristics both my partner and I tended to agree with each others with our scores. The visability of system status, error prevention, recognition rather than recall, and help and documentation of habitica all met the desired effects and recieved 10's. We knocked a few points off of the match between system and the real world, user control and freedom, consistency and standards, flexibility and efficiency of use, and aesthetic and minimalist design scores. The website was gamer themed and had terms a non gamer might not recognize immediately, they had a tracker section that could be cleared but only in set intervals and didn't promote complete freedom and control, had a group of features where 2/3 were interacted with the same way but the third was different, it had some features and content locked behind a subscription pay wall, and felt a little overwhelming for a first time user. We knocked the most points off of their 'help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors' section since they didn't provide a lot of solutions to the errors that we had experienced. We were notified but not instructed. 

## Conclusions

Habitica had a decent layout with clean UI. They put the most important interactable sections, like the habits to track and edit, front and center. It is important to keep the main focus of the app easily and readily accessible with good labels and intuitive design. They also used an interesting reward structure via coins and items awarded to users on top of their progress. An aspect Habitica could improve on is if a user is misusing the app, they are notified and advised on how to use it correctly.

## Caveats

As a team, we are only made up of two people, having more people participate in heuristic evaluations would add more of a wider range of experiences as well as a fuller discussion. Both of us are tech literate so we were not able to fully get the experiences from someone who could be newer to tech and who understands less. We also only evaluated one competitor and it might not fully cover the range of competition between habit trackers. Other research methods if conducted could also bring us a fuller analysis but we do not have enough time or resources to conduct some of them.
